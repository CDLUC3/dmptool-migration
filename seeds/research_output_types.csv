"dataset","Dataset","Data encoded in a defined structure."
"event","Event","A non-persistent, time-based occurrence. (i.e. Descriptive information and/or content that is the basis for discovery of the purpose, location, duration, and responsible agents associated with an event such as a webcast or convention)"
"image","Image","A visual representation other than text. (e.g. Digitised or born digital images, drawings or photographs)"
